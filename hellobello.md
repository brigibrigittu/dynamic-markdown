During a hot September 3, 2000, game in Irving, Texas, when temperatures on the field of Texas Stadium reached **109 degrees**, Philadelphia players [chugged] pickle juice and credited the briny solution for their 41-14 win. The Eagles outgained Dallas 425-167, and defensive end Hugh Douglass said, _“I may start drinking pickle juice when I’m home chilling.”_

A BYU study later confirmed that drinking pickle juice can help relieve a cramp **37 percent** faster than drinking water.
